# Hi Dan.

Branched conversations are hierarchical structures. Since we can graph them, we can navigate them physically as we navigate them temporally. Here's a fun little animation.

## Check it out

Clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:joeLepper/who.git
```

Then, inside your new `who` directory:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Upon that finishing successfully:

```bash
npm start
```

You know have a web server listening for requests [here](`http://localhost:5556/`).

## What could I do to it?

Unless you're willing to get your hands real dirty, not much.

Check out `src/people/b.json` if you're interested in trying to hand-roll the branched conversation story format.
